A small Game of Life implementation in one Java class.

To run the program, pass a starting state on the command line:

java Life 001,010,100

This will run one iteration of the game, and print out the next 
state in the same format. State strings are in row-major format.  
Each one or zero is a column going left to right across the board.  
Rows are separated by commas.  The example above starts the game 
with the following matrix:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
